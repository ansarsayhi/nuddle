not 100% finished, but the main things are there

how it works?

1. you run main.pu
2. it will scrap courses from NU and create a database 
3. it should set up the web-up based on Streamlit
4. you can choose 4 courses that you take as a NU student
5. you can toggle the special mode by clickong on the button and select time when you're busy
6. the program will choose sessions in your courses so you will have minimal gaps between classes within each day, also considering your selected busy time
7. If your selected time and classes will inevitably clash, the program will just try to disrupt your personal schedule as less as possible (there's a penalty system in the algorithm)


You probably need:
1. python + all the frameworks (streamlit, playwright)
2. edit interface.py to suit your local system
